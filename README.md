Publication: Kim, E., Atteraya, M. Analyzing the Degree of Changes in Indexed Journals: The Case of SJR Database. Pub Res Q 40, 129â€“146 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1007/s12109-024-09991-3

This code analyzes indexed journals, calculating journal count, Jaccard Index, growth rate, and normalized growth rate. It introduces the quadrant approach, categorizing journals into Q1 to Q4 based on Jaccard index and normalized growth rate. Example vectors illustrate metric application, offering insights into changing journal landscapes. The SJR data used in this analysis is available from the SCImago Journal & Country Rank website (https://www.scimagojr.com), which compiles journal rankings based on citation data from the Scopus database.
